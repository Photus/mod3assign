 				<p>This book is largely concerned with Hobbits, and from its
				pages a reader may discover much of their character and a
				little of their history. Further information will also be found
				in the selection from the Red Book of Westmarch that has
				already been published, under the title of The Hobbit. That
				story was derived from the earlier chapters of the Red Book,
				composed by Bilbo himself, the first Hobbit to become
				famous in the world at large, and called by him There and
				Back Again, since they told of his journey into the East and
				his return: an adventure which later involved all the Hobbits
				in the great events of that Age that are here related.
				Many, however, may wish to know more about this remarkable
				people from the outset, while some may not possess
				the earlier book. For such readers a few notes on the more
				important points are here collected from Hobbit-lore, and
				the first adventure is briefly recalled. <br><br> This book is largely concerned with Hobbits, and from its
